Here are the issues I got when I am working with ubuntu and their solutions.

--> Working with webpack watches are must.Sometimes you use more the normal limits.
--> To start the watches DO THIS.

sudo sysctl fs.inotify.max_user_watches=524288

--> Set the maximux heap memory size for node when head gets out of memory.
DO.This --> export NODE_OPTIONS=--max_old_space_size=4096
