==> What is memoization.

Memoization is the process of caching the output of function calls so that subsequent calls are faster. 
Calling the function again with the same input will return the cached output without needing to do the calculation again.
A basic implementation in JavaScript looks like this:

const memoize = fn => {
  const cache = new Map()
  return value => {
    const cachedResult = cache.get(value)
    if (cachedResult !== undefined) return cachedResult
    const result = fn(value)
    cache.set(value, result)
    return result
  }
}
