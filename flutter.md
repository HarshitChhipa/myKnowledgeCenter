# Base of Flutter

## Get packages for an existing flutter project.
- flutter pub get


## Give access to the gradlew user.

## Sometimes you get old app instead of new app that is due to the caching of build folder that creates "APK" from old code.
- Run `Flutter clean`
- and then `flutter run` or `flutter build apk`

## Making a Release build for playstore.
- Try to make appbundles as they are compatible with 32 and 64 bit `flutter build appbundle`
